## General Information
- The bike-sharing provider BoomBikes in US has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- Background of this project is to analyze a bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- The business probem of this project is that we have to make model with the available independent variables so that it will be used by the management to understand how exactly the  demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
- Bike Sharing dataset is used.

## Conclusions
- Feeling Temperature(atemp): A coefficient value of ‘0.535’ indicates that a temperature has significant impact on bike rentals.
- Light_rainsnow: A coefficient value of ‘-0.237’ indicates that the light snow and rain deters people from renting out bikes.
- Year (yr): A coefficient value of ‘0.231’ indicates that a year wise the rental numbers are increasing.
- Demands increases in the month of Aug, Sep, season of Summer, Winter, day of Saturday, yr.
- Demands decreases in the month of Jan, Light_rainsnow, Misty, hum, windspeed.
